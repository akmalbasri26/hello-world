## What is the best telco provider available?

Voxi. Easy. It offers unlimited data for social media with data package starting from £10 for 6GB. You can apply online and they will send straight to your door (Malaysia, but will be confirmed). Please explore other providers as well such as Three, BT, and others. Users also are not stick to any plan by any form of contracts, so that means you can change your data plan anytime.

However, a heads up for Voxi or generally any prepaid telco users, if you used up all your data for the month, there is no way you can reset to get back all the data back for the month unless waiting for the next month to come. But you can still purchase additional data. Alternatively, you may opt for telcos with unlimited mobile data and hotspot like Three, but that will cost higher (£12 monthly for student).

## How do I keep my Malaysian number active?

There are a few validity plans by different telco. Such as 365 days validity and 10GB basic internet by TuneTalk which cost RM100 while Maxis offers RM60 but for 500MB internet.

## What are the entertainments available?

The parks are everywhere. Bars are everywhere as well, if that suits your taste. Cinemas and theatre, shopping complex, sports complex, gyms, ice skating, bowling centres and others. Doesn’t differ much from Malaysia.

## How big should my luggage be?

Varies. Check the check-in luggage size and weight for your own ticket. Usually it’s 30-35kg for check-in luggage.

## What does it mean by academic year and terms?

Academic year refers to September to May. While term is another word for semesters.

## Can I drive in UK?

Your Malaysian license allows you to drive in the UK only for 12 months, afterwards it’s invalid.

## I am concern about changing of skincare products when flying to the UK. May I have some about that, like where can I buy the products?

Like Malaysia, we can buy the products online or offline. Let me list some shops and websites where you can look for the products at. Firstly, I would say Boots and Superdrug is the counterpart of Watsons and Guardians for the UK. You can visit the stores or order from their online websites or mobile app. Some available brands there includes Cerave, Cetaphil, Olay, Neutrogena, Nivea, La Roche-Posay, Eucerin, Garnier, No7, Simple and many more. Some additional websites are Beautybay (for brands such as The Ordinary, Cosrx, more), iHerb (Aveeno, K Beauty, more) and Deciem (The Ordinary, Hylamide, NIOD, more). Also, you can find some asean brands like Hado Labo at Amazon.  
If you are finding a new product or have any particular product planned to use, try look at the websites mentioned and search for the particular product. Or you can browse through to find which product you wanna use later!
