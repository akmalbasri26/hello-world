## How is the healthcare system here?

You will pay for National Health Service (NHS) when you are applying for your VISA (it cost you a fortune but you can claim from MARA). Equipped with this, you are entitled to access NHS care just like the citizens. This includes at hospital and General Practitioner (GP). GP is basically the doctor you meet at clinics in Malaysia.

## What should I be aware of when I’m in the public?

Pay full attention to your surroundings. Pickpocket happens everywhere. If you carry a bag with you, make sure it’s properly closed. In crowded places, if it makes you feel safer, put your bag in front of you. If you wish to put valuable things in your bag, make sure it is placed at hidden or hard-to-access spaces. We will surely touch about this again when you guys arrive, no worry!

## How does scammers scam?

You can search them online, there are articles about it. Usually, they claimed as police officers or someone from taxing company. They might check your bag because they want to check for cocaine because they ‘could’ smell it or ask you to pay stuff or else you are going to be arrested. So, what to do? Go to nearest police station to settle any business. Hypnosis or ‘pukau’ also happened, but all these things are less than common. There is also the “I am lost” scam. Again, we will surely touch about this again when you guys arrive, no worries!
