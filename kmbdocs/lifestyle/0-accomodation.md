## Where do I search for accommodation?
You can search for accommodations here: 
- **University accommodations**
- **Private student accommodations** (e.g. from this [blog](https://www.unilodgers.com/uk/london/student-accommodation)) 
- **Private rentals:** Zoopla, Rightmove, OpenRent, Gumtree. 
- **Hostels:** Beaumont House, Victoria League Student House and University of London Housing Services.

**Tips:** For easy search of private rentals, we highly recommend joining these two Facebook groups: **Malaysian Students Good Exchange London** and **Malaysia Students Flat Exchange London.**

## How do I start searching for accommodation?
Searching for accommodation can be tough. Here are a few pointers:
- From the list mentioned in (a), you can start by looking at the prices of the accommodation and start listing them in a separate document. Then, you can choose which one that suits your budget.
- You may also contact any of your seniors as they might have available rooms in their current house, or might know of available houses from their landlords.

**Tips:** In any case, make sure to get help from those who have experience. Don’t be afraid to seek help! You really don’t want to get involved in any housing scams.

## What is the affordable amount for rent?
Anywhere around £600 is reasonable. Another way to think about it is you want to spend roughly 55% of your monthly allowance on rent. Note that you have to pay bills such as water, electricity and Wi-Fi as well.

## How to calculate your monthly rent?
It is common for websites to state the rent amount as a weekly rate (as opposed to monthly rate). To convert this into monthly rate, use the following formula:

**Monthly Rent for the House = Weekly Wate * 52 weeks / 12 months**
** Monthly Rent per Person = Monthly Rent for the House / Number of Tenants**

**Example:** For instance, the weekly rent for the whole house is £600. So, the monthly rent for the whole house is £600 * 52/12 = £2600. Therefore, to calculate the monthly rate per person, just divide it by the number of tenants in the house. For example, 4 tenants.   The final amount will be £2600 / 4 = £650.

## How do I choose the properties for accommodation?
The general rule of thumb is that the rent is lower if it is further away from Central London. Keep in mind that travel costs by tube increases with respect to London zones.*

Choose based on these criteria:
1. Distance from your accommodation to campus 
2. Price
3. Security – certain areas are a bit dodgy. Do check the crime statistics [here](https://www.met.police.uk/).
4. Facilities – near to grocery store, tube or bus station.
5. Landlord – find a reasonable landlord. Read the reviews to find more about them.

**Tips:** It is advisable to avoid East London as it is a bit further from the majority of universities and more dodgy areas. But if you found one, do ask us for advice :)

## What to do if I am requested a UK guarantor when signing a house contract?
One of the downsides of private rentals (as opposed to student accommodations) is needing additional things like a UK guarantor.

Here are a few things you can do (in order):
1. Certain lenient landlords/agents accept non-UK based guarantors; so discuss with them upon a guarantor request.
2. Negotiate with your landlord/agent to get them to accept your sponsor’s Financial Statement (FS) as a guarantee.
3. Use the guarantor service provided by your university. However, bear in mind that during this pandemic, some university services might be unavailable. 
U4. se guarantor services such as Housing Hand or UKGuarantor.

**LAST RESORT:** In the case where you are not able to secure a UK guarantor, you can, as a last resort, opt for a 6-month lump sum payment. But this is NOT advisable at all.

For this undesirable situation, the strategy is the following:
1. For the initial 6-months, use the lump sum money you receive from MARA to cover this. 
2. Appeal to your landlord that you want to pay your rent monthly after the 6 months period is up.
3. Request a proof of allowance from MARA London to back up your appeal. This is because you’ll be receiving your rent on a monthly basis. 

*Note that this option does have the slight risk of the landlord not accepting the proof of payment. So again, this is a LAST RESORT only!*

**Tips:** Do not be afraid to negotiate! Explain your situation to the agent/landlord. They will most probably consider your constraints and offer something that will work for both parties. Remember, the landlords need you as much as you need them! They need your money.

## I found a suitable accommodation but it is a bit expensive. Is there any way to negotiate the price?
Some options to consider include:
- Negotiate with the landlord to add more tenants. The general principle is that: The more the tenants, the cheaper the rent per person.
- Let them know you have financial constrictions. Some landlords are thoughtful and willing to reduce their prices.

## I cannot seem to find a house before arrival. What should I do?
This is actually a far more common situation than you would expect. You can either stay at a friend’s house or rent an Airbnb while you are looking for a new accommodation.

**NOTE:** It is highly non-advisable to treat this as an option. View this as a last resort!
